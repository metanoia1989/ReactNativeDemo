# messaging app

We’ll use the following APIs:
- Alert - Displays modal dialog windows for simple user input
- BackHandler - Controls the back button on Android
- CameraRoll - Returns images and videos stored on the device
- Dimensions - Returns the dimensions of the screen
- Geolocation - Returns the location of the device, and emits events when the location changes
- Keyboard - Emits events when the keyboard appears or disappears
- NetInfo - Returns network connectivity information, and emits events when the connectivity changes
- PixelRatio - Translates from density-independent pixels to density-dependent pixels (more detail on the later)
- StatusBar - Controls the visibility and color of the status bar

We’ll just be focusing on the UI, so we won’t actually send messages, but we could connect the UI we build to a backend if we wanted to use it in a production app.
